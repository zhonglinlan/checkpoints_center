# checkpoints_center  
This is a repository for storing our checkpoints per week.  
We all should update our own directory per week.

**Note**: You should create a folder named after you and put your own contents inside it. We have a strong strategy for reviewing your pull request and it means any request without this priciple will be rejected.
